# Demo

[Try it here!](https://robopro.github.io/pederpong/)

# Run it locally

TS is bundled into app.js, so just run `index.html` in your browser and you're good to go.

# Additional notes

Using esbuild to bundle TypeScript. If you want to mess around with the code run your `npm install` equivalent commands and `npm run watch` or `npm run build` to bundle.
